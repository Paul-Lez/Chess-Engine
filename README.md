# Chess-Engine
This repo contains a Python implementation of a chess engine using the Python `chess` library to manage the game side of things (e.g. keeping track of the current position, 
whether or not the game has ended, etc). The move generation algorithm uses negamax with alpha-beta prunning. Next on the todo list is adding move ordering heuristics.
